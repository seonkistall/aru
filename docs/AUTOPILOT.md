# ARU Autopilot

A scheduled session picks this file up every 6 hours, does one cycle, and writes
back to it. It is the only state that survives between cycles — a fresh session
starts with no memory of the last one.

Last updated: 2026-09-15

## What this is for

ARU should end up used by real people and earning money. The loop exists to make
the product better every cycle without a human in the seat for each one.

Be clear-eyed about what the loop can and cannot move:

- **It can** raise product quality, close the ML gap, fix bugs, tighten the funnel,
  and prepare everything a launch needs.
- **It cannot** acquire users, sign an affiliate contract, or create demand. Those
  are owner actions, and they sit in BLOCKERS below.

### The revenue arithmetic, written down so no cycle forgets it

Target: **$10,000 / month**. ARU's only revenue surface today is the commerce
out-link (`/api/out` → `lib/commerce.ts`).

| Quantity | Value | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Typical Korean skincare basket | ~₩30,000 (~$22) | catalogue price band in `lib/skus.ts` |
| Affiliate commission | **7%** on a recommended item, 3% on another item bought through the link | 올리브영 쇼핑 큐레이터 terms, 2026-09-15 |
| Revenue per converted click | ~₩2,100 (~$1.5) at 7% | basket × commission |
| Conversions needed per month | **~6,700** | $10,000 ÷ revenue per conversion |
| Scan→purchase conversion (optimistic) | 2–5% | affiliate-content benchmark, unverified for this product |
| Monthly scans implied | **~100,000–700,000** | conversions ÷ conversion rate |

Two things follow, and every cycle should act on them rather than re-deriving them:

Rates by programme, as far as they could be verified on 2026-09-15 (Korean sites are
blocked from the build network, so these come from search results, not from pages this
repository opened):

| Programme | Rate | Channel it accepts | Verified? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 올리브영 쇼핑 큐레이터 | 7% recommended item / 3% other item via the link | in-app curator links, shared to external channels | rate stated consistently across sources |
| 네이버 쇼핑 커넥트 | 5–28% per product, 1.8% cross-store | creator space + an owned channel | whether a web service qualifies is **unverified** |
| 쿠팡 파트너스 | **unverified** — sources say 3%, 1–3%, and 5% for beauty | website and mobile-app URLs may be registered | channel support is stated in the official guide |

Note the programme name: it is **네이버 쇼핑 커넥트**, not "쇼핑파트너" (쇼핑파트너센터 is
the seller-side console). An earlier version of this file had it wrong.

Two things follow, and every cycle should act on them rather than re-deriving them:

1. **The links earn $0 today.** `addCommerceTracking()` adds UTM parameters only —
   no affiliate or partner id. `COMMERCE_LINK_OVERRIDES_JSON` is the designed
   insertion point for real affiliate URLs. Until the owner signs up for the
   programmes, 100% of traffic monetises at zero, whatever the loop builds.
   **When that env is set, `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE=on` must be set in the same
   deploy** — see `affiliateDisclosureActive()`. Live affiliate URLs with the
   disclosure still reading "no commission" is a false statement to users and, under
   올리브영's curator terms, forfeits the payout.
2. **Traffic is the binding constraint, not features.** At six figures of monthly
   scans the product needs to be excellent; at zero scans it does not matter how
   excellent it is. Cycles should prefer work that either (a) makes the product
   worth returning to and sharing, or (b) instruments what actually happens, over
   work that only adds surface.

## Standing objective: run until $10,000/month

The owner's instruction, 2026-09-15: keep the 6-hourly cycle running until ARU earns
more than **$10,000 in a month**. Two things must be said plainly so no cycle pretends
otherwise.

**The loop cannot see revenue.** Nothing in this repository records a sale. Affiliate
earnings live in the merchants' dashboards, behind accounts the loop has no business
touching. So the stop condition is owner-reported: the owner writes the month's figure
into the table below, and until a line there exceeds $10,000 the cycle keeps running.
A cycle must never infer, estimate, or celebrate revenue from anything in the codebase.

**The loop cannot create demand.** It can make the product worth returning to and worth
sending to a friend; it cannot sign an affiliate contract or bring traffic. Those stay
in BLOCKERS and stay the owner's.

### Revenue log (owner fills this in)

| Month | Revenue | Source | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09 | $0 | — | No affiliate id exists in the codebase; every out-click earns $0. |

### What "revenue-upstream" means when ordering the backlog

While that table reads $0, prefer work in this order. It is not a rule against quality
work — a broken product converts nothing — but a tie-breaker when two items look equally
worth doing.

1. **Anything that makes an existing click earn money.** The affiliate plumbing is the
   clearest case: `COMMERCE_LINK_OVERRIDES_JSON` is the designed insertion point and is
   empty, and every link currently lands on a *search results page* rather than a product
   page. That second one is a conversion leak the loop can fix today, without waiting for
   the owner's programme applications.
2. **Anything that makes the funnel observable.** Optimising what you cannot measure is
   guessing. `lib/funnel.ts` is still localStorage-only.
3. **Anything that makes one user bring another.** The share loop is the only organic
   acquisition path the product has.
4. **Everything else** — model quality, subgroup fairness, defects, polish. Still real
   work, still lands every cycle; it just does not win a tie against 1-3 while the
   revenue line reads zero.

## One cycle

Each firing does all of this, in order. One coherent improvement per track is
better than four half-finished ones.

1. **Orient.** Read this file. Run `git log --oneline -10` and read the last
   CHANGELOG entries so the cycle does not redo finished work.
2. **Verify green.** `npm run smoke` must pass before any change. If it is red,
   fixing that is the whole cycle.

   In a sandboxed worker, export `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` first:

   ```bash
   PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome npm run smoke
   ```

   `@playwright/test` 1.61.1 pins chromium build 1228; the container ships 1194, and
   `npx playwright install chromium` is refused by the egress proxy
   (`403 ... no rule or allowlist entry allows host "cdn.playwright.dev"`). Without the
   override all 44 mobile E2E specs fail at browser launch and smoke reads red while
   nothing in the product is broken. Unset, Playwright resolves its own build, so CI is
   unchanged. Find the path with `ls /opt/pw-browsers` — the build number moves.

   Also: pipe smoke through `tee` and it reports `tee`'s exit code, not its own. Check for
   the literal `Smoke test passed.` line, not `$?` at the end of a pipeline.
3. **Research** (자료조사). One concrete question that the next step needs
   answered — a dataset licence, a Play policy, a Korean affiliate programme's
   terms, a competitor's onboarding, an ML technique. Verify against a primary
   source; record the finding and the source in the right doc. Never record a
   search snippet as a fact.
4. **ML.** Move the scan model forward: calibration, subgroup coverage, an index
   that needs validating, a metric that is missing, an inconsistency between
   `lib/skin.ts` and the Python pipeline. `python ml/selftest.py` must stay green.
5. **UI/UX and user flow.** One real improvement to what a user sees or how far
   they get: a drop-off in `lib/funnel.ts`, a screen that is confusing on a
   360px phone, copy that overpromises, a locale that reads like a translation.
6. **Bug fix.** Hunt actively rather than waiting for a report: run the app, read
   an error path, check a boundary. Fix at least one real defect, with a test
   that fails without the fix.
7. **Land it.** `npm run smoke` green → commit → push a branch → open a PR →
   merge it → update this file's CHANGELOG and BACKLOG → update `README.md` if
   anything a reader would care about changed.

Use subagents freely for fan-out — parallel research angles, parallel review
lenses, adversarial verification of anything before it is written down as true.
Verification is where the loop earns its keep: an unverified "improvement" that
looks right is worse than no change, because the next cycle builds on it.

## Hard guardrails

These are not preferences. Breaking one is worse than skipping a cycle.

1. **Never push a red build.** `npm run smoke` green before every push, no exceptions.
   If it cannot be made green, revert the change and record why in BLOCKERS.
2. **Never fabricate evidence.** Every number written into a doc, PR body or
   CHANGELOG must be the actual output of a command that actually ran. Paste real
   output. If a run was not done, say it was not done.
3. **Never make a medical claim.** ARU describes cosmetic tendencies visible in a
   photo. No diagnosis, no treatment, no condition monitoring, in any language.
   `efficacyClean()` stays on every LLM product reason.
4. **Never merge the two consent streams** (AI analysis / learning crop) or weaken
   the audit trail.
5. **Never ship a face image off-device** beyond the existing consented crop path,
   and never write a person identifier next to their measurements in an export.
6. **Never commit dataset images**, model weights over a few MB, or anything from a
   gated dataset.
7. **Never change a dataset licence tier** on anything other than a term the owner
   has actually read and reported. The current tiers and their evidence live in
   `ml/external_datasets.json`.
8. **Never promote a model** past the gate in `public/models/visible-attributes/manifest.json`.
9. **Surgical changes only.** Every diff traces to a backlog item or a defect. No
   refactor-for-its-own-sake, no dependency added without a reason in the PR body.
10. **Never push to `main` directly.** Branch → PR → merge.

## Backlog

`[AI]` the loop can do alone. `[OWNER]` needs a human, an account, or a signature.

### Now

- [AI] **Deep-link the commerce out-links to product pages.** Every entry in
  `buildCommerceLinks` (`lib/commerce.ts`) currently points at a merchant *search* URL —
  `oliveYoungSearchUrl`, `naverShoppingSearchUrl`, `coupangSearchUrl` all build
  `?query=<brand> <name>`. A user who taps "올리브영" lands on a result list and has to
  pick the product again, which is the largest avoidable drop between intent and
  purchase, and it will still be there the day affiliate ids arrive. Resolve stable
  product URLs per SKU where they exist, keep the search URL as the fallback for the
  ones that do not, and keep `isAllowedCommerceUrl` as the gate. Do not invent URLs:
  a link that 404s is worse than a search page, so anything unverified stays a search
  URL and gets recorded as unverified.
  **2026-09-15: attempted and stopped, deliberately.** Every merchant host refuses this
  network, so not one product URL could be verified to resolve, and the item's own rule
  says an unverifiable URL stays a search URL. Verbatim:

  ```
  --- https://www.oliveyoung.co.kr/store/main/main.do
  curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
  --- https://search.shopping.naver.com/search/all?query=test
  curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
  --- https://www.coupang.com/np/search?q=test
  curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
  --- https://global.oliveyoung.com/
  curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
  --- https://www.google.com/search?q=test
  curl: (56) CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
  ```

  Nor is the answer hiding in the repo: the 22 files in `public/products` are named
  `cl1.jpg`…`tn3.jpg` and carry no merchant goods number, and the only `goodsNo` string
  anywhere in the tree is the `PARTNER_GOODS_NO` placeholder in the playbook. So this
  needs either an allowlisted host for the worker or the owner pasting real product
  URLs. What the cycle *could* fix without a network is the override path those URLs
  will arrive through — see the changelog entry below; it was silently discarding them.
- [AI] `confidenceLabel` no longer distinguishes reading ambiguity. After the
  2026-09-15 fix, a frame whose three capture signals all pass lands in
  [0.7804, 0.9424], and the 높음 gate is 0.78 — so it reads 높음 even when all three
  readings sit exactly on their cut points. The label is now a restatement of capture
  quality, and it clears the gate by 0.0004, so any later nudge of the 0.695 floor or
  the 0.78 threshold flips every well-captured scan at once. Decide whether the
  attribute term should get more travel in `readsFromRaw`, or whether the label should
  be dropped to two levels. Note `confidenceLabel` is duplicated byte-for-byte in
  `app/scan/capture-analysis.ts`.
- [AI] Decide whether ONE failed capture signal should force a retake. Measured after
  the 2026-09-15 `distanceConfidence` fix: `retakeRecommended` is
  `confidence < 0.58 || retakeReasons.length >= 2`, and with confidence no longer
  collapsing on unambiguous readings the lowest reachable value with 2 of 3 signals
  passing is 0.6871, so a single failed signal can no longer trip the gate. Two or more
  failures still do, via the reason count. The old code caught the single-failure case
  only as a side effect of the inversion — i.e. by accident — but "피부 영역" failing
  alone does genuinely undermine the pores reading, so this deserves an explicit rule
  rather than an accident. Numbers above are from a `node` evaluation of the new
  function against the real `attrConfidence * 0.72 + signalScore * 0.28` weighting.
- [AI] Validate the blemish-detection constants (`BLEMISH` in `lib/skin.ts`) against
  real photos through `/eval`, and replace them with calibrated values. They were
  chosen on a synthetic face.
- [AI] **The report headline survives the vision merge and can contradict the rows
  under it.** `mergeVisionAnalysis` (`app/scan/capture-analysis.ts:186`) rewrites
  `oil`, `redness`, `pores`, `confidence`, `confidenceLabel`, `retakeRecommended` and
  `source`, but `headline` arrives through `...base` and is never recomputed — and
  `headlineFor`/`narrativeParts` are module-private in `lib/skin.ts`, so it cannot be.
  With a vision key set and the user consenting, the `<h1>` on `/report` and the scan
  receipt can read 피부 컨디션이 비교적 안정적이에요 directly above rows reading
  붉은기 뚜렷. `readsFromRaw` on the ML path derives both from the merged buckets, so
  the two paths already disagree. Second-order: `localizedNarrative` rebuilds the
  sentence from the levels for non-Korean locales but returns the stored Korean one
  as-is, so a Korean user sees the stale narrative and an English user the corrected
  one from the same object. Fix by exporting the two helpers and recomputing from
  `next.*` after the per-attribute loop, keeping `payload.narrative` as the override
  it already is. Found 2026-09-15; not fixed in that cycle only to keep the diff
  surgical.
- [AI] `blemishDensity` in `lib/skin.ts` counts on a fixed 90-cell grid and divides by
  an area in real capture pixels, so it scales as roughly 1/faceWidth² and is not
  comparable across capture resolutions. Nothing user-visible reads it today, but it
  feeds the device/tone subgroup work. Noted 2026-09-15, not measured.
- [AI] `auditCommerceOverrides` (`lib/commerce.ts`) has no production caller — only
  the internal `warnOnce` and its tests — so its accepted/rejected split is visible in
  the request log and nowhere an operator would look. Surface it: `/ops`, or the
  `/api/sync` GET status handler, is the natural home, and doing so would also let it
  check the sku id against the catalogue, which it cannot do from inside
  `lib/commerce.ts` (`lib/skus.ts` imports that module, so it would be a cycle). Until
  then a misspelled sku in `COMMERCE_LINK_OVERRIDES_JSON` is still a silent no-op —
  pinned by `tests/commerce.test.ts` "does not yet catch a misspelled sku id".
- [AI] Two camera dead-ends are still off the funnel or mislabelled. `interruptCamera`
  (`app/scan/page.tsx`) puts the UI in a dead end with a 카메라 다시 켜기 button when
  the live track dies — another app taking the camera — and records nothing; the fix
  belongs at the `watchCameraStream` callback, not inside `interruptCamera`, whose
  other two callers are `visibilitychange`/`pagehide` and are just backgrounding. And
  the stream-attach failure path records `camera_blocked {reason:"attach"}` and calls
  `setPhase("denied")` without `setDeniedReason`, so the screen shows whichever reason
  was last set (default 권한). Both found 2026-09-15 by adversarial review of that
  cycle's own diff.
- [AI] Server-side funnel telemetry. `lib/funnel.ts` is localStorage-only, so nobody
  can see where users drop off. Without it every UX cycle is guessing. (Still open —
  2026-09-15 added `share_landed` and `viralActivation`, but they are still on-device.)
- [x] [AI] ~~Four more drop-offs are uninstrumented~~ — done 2026-09-15. `home_viewed`,
  `scan_opened`, `camera_blocked`, `care_viewed` and `checkin_opened` now fire, with
  `captureStart` and `cameraBlockRate` in the summary and in `/ops`. Still on-device:
  the server-side item above is what makes any of this readable by a human.
- [AI] Measure the real per-scan cost of the new within-image indices on a mid-range
  phone profile, not on the build container.
- [AI] The ordinal floor is 0.40/0.40 and provisional — it was chosen from synthetic
  predictors because no labelled ARU validation set exists yet
  (`docs/ordinal-metric-verification.md`). The first real training run should report
  its own qwk and pearson and the floor should be re-set against those, not against
  the synthetic table. Do not raise it on a hunch, and do not lower it to make a run
  pass.
- [AI] `funnelDropoff` still anchors its cumulative chart on `scan_started`, so the
  camera loss `scan_opened` now measures does not appear in the drop-off bars — it is
  only in the summary (`captureStart`, `cameraBlockRate`). Moving the anchor would
  zero every stage of an event log recorded before `scan_opened` existed, because the
  chart is an intersection from stage 0. Revisit once logs in hand all contain it.
- [~] [AI] Share surface: audit `app/components/share-card.tsx` against what actually
  renders in KakaoTalk. **Partly answered** 2026-09-15 in `docs/share-preview-findings.md`
  — the structural half is settled, the Kakao-render half is not and needs a phone. The
  og tags are already correct and already static; the blocker is structural, not a bug.
  A per-result preview is impossible while the levels live in the URL fragment, which
  is the very thing that keeps them off the server. Kakao's own scraper spec could not
  be fetched (egress-blocked), so the Kakao-specific half of this item is now in BLOCKERS.
  The receiving half of the loop is now instrumented (`share_landed`).
- [AI] Decide the share-preview fork recorded in `docs/share-preview-findings.md`.
  Option B (levels in a query param) is the only way to a per-result card and it puts
  skin levels in server and messenger logs. Needs an owner call, not a loop decision.
- [AI] `viralActivation` now has a denominator but no baseline. Once any real traffic
  exists, read it before changing the share surface again.
- [OWNER] **Apply to the affiliate programmes** — 쿠팡 파트너스 (self-serve, accepts a
  website or app URL as the channel), 올리브영 쇼핑 큐레이터 (in-app, 7%/3%), 네이버 쇼핑
  커넥트 (5–28%, confirm a web service counts as a channel). Until then every out-click
  earns $0. This is the single highest-leverage item on the whole list. The in-product
  disclosure is already shipped and waiting on `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE=on`.
- [OWNER] AI-Hub 71645 data application (domestic applicant, account required).
- [OWNER] Golden set: 20–30 real photos with two-operator consensus labels, so the
  camera thresholds come from faces instead of from a synthetic frame.

### Next

- [x] [AI] ~~The promotion gate still reads only `accuracy` and the unused
  `worstOrdinalMae`~~ — done 2026-09-15. `promotionGate.ordinal` in the shipped
  manifest now carries `minQwk` / `minPearson` (both 0.40, provisional), mirrored in
  `model_contract.FALLBACK_ORDINAL_GATE`, and `subgroups.ordinal_check` blocks per
  axis — including when an axis reports no qwk at all, on the same rule that makes an
  unevaluated subgroup a blocker. Both scorers were verified against scikit-learn and
  SciPy first (`docs/ordinal-metric-verification.md`); the floor was chosen from a
  measured table of predictors, not from a benchmark nobody here can open.

- [AI] `minSamplesPerBand` is compared against the wrong unit. `_aggregate` in
  `ml/train_visible_attributes.py` sums `n` ACROSS axes, and `worst_group` gates on
  that sum. Reproduced by feeding the real `_aggregate` one cell of 10 samples
  labelled on the three default axes:

  ```
  real samples in the cell:  10
  labelled axes           :  3
  n reported to worst_group: 30
  manifest minSamplesPerBand: 20
  clears the floor?          True
  ```

  So a subgroup a third the size of the documented floor is evaluated as if it met it.
  `fit_tone_calibration` in the same file uses the correct per-axis unit, and
  `coverage_warnings` uses raw row counts — three meanings for one manifest number.
- [AI] `raw.toneIta` has no behavioural test anywhere, and it is the sole input to tone
  band assignment on both first-party ingest paths. A radians/degrees slip in
  `lib/skin.ts` would put every sample in `brown_dark`, collapse the tone dimension to
  one cell, and every existing check would still pass.
- [AI] Tone and dryness have no label source. Propose the smallest consented way to
  collect one, with the PIPA consequences spelled out; do not implement it alone.
- [AI] Recommendation quality: the reasons are LLM-generated and efficacy-filtered,
  but nothing measures whether they are *useful*. Design a measurable proxy.
- [AI] iPhone Safari camera matrix is code-verified but hardware-pending; extend the
  automated lifecycle coverage as far as it can go without hardware.
- [OWNER] Google Play Console identity, payment account, support email, App Signing.

## Blockers

Owner-only, dated when first recorded.

- 2026-09-14 — Affiliate programme sign-ups. No partner id exists anywhere in the
  codebase; `COMMERCE_LINK_OVERRIDES_JSON` is ready to receive real URLs.
- 2026-09-14 — AI-Hub 71645 data itself. Licence is `commercial_ok` on the owner's
  reading of the terms; the data still needs an approved application.
- 2026-09-14 — Real golden-set photos with consensus labels.
- 2026-09-14 — Physical-device QA: iPhone Safari matrix, Play internal track.
- 2026-09-15 — The share-preview fork in `docs/share-preview-findings.md`. Per-result
  link previews require moving the skin levels out of the URL fragment and into the
  request target, where ARU's server and the messenger's scraper both log them. PIPA
  consequence, owner decision.
- 2026-09-15 — Egress. This worker cannot reach `developers.kakao.com`, `ogp.me`,
  `www.rfc-editor.org`, `partners.coupang.com`, `adpartners.coupang.com`,
  `partner.naver.com`, `www.oliveyoung.co.kr` or `cdn.playwright.dev`. So the research
  track cannot verify Kakao's scraper spec or any affiliate commission term from a
  primary source, and the `3-10%` commission band in the revenue table above stays
  unverified. Either allowlist those hosts for the worker or the owner reads the terms.
  Re-probed 2026-09-15 and widened: `search.shopping.naver.com`, `www.coupang.com`,
  `global.oliveyoung.com` and `www.google.com` all refuse too (`CONNECT tunnel failed,
  response 403`), which is what stops the deep-link item, and so do
  `developer.mozilla.org`, `en.wikipedia.org`, `scikit-learn.org`, `arxiv.org`,
  `support.google.com` and `developers.google.com`. The second group was first recorded
  as `http=000`, which is the same refusal seen through a curl invocation that swallows
  the message — not a different outcome. Of everything probed only `pypi.org` answered
  (`http=200`), which is the one thing that made this cycle's metric verification
  possible at all.
- 2026-09-15 — Which host a real affiliate link lands on. The override allowlist in
  `lib/commerce.ts` accepts `www.oliveyoung.co.kr`, `search.shopping.naver.com`,
  `www.coupang.com` and `www.google.com`. A 네이버 쇼핑 커넥트 link is likely on a
  smart-store or brand-store host and a 쿠팡 파트너스 link on a redirect host, neither
  of which is on the list, and neither could be verified from here. It is a one-line
  change once the owner has a real link in hand — but it must not be guessed, because
  the allowlist is what stops `/api/out` becoming an open redirect. A wrong host now
  logs loudly instead of failing silently.

## How the schedule actually runs

A Routine that creates its own fresh session **cannot do this job**, and the reason is
worth keeping written down because it costs a day to rediscover.

`create_trigger` has no parameter for a repository source, so every session it spawns
starts with `sources: []`. A session without the repo declared as a source hits an
approval prompt the moment it writes to that repo, and an unattended session has nobody
to approve it, so it stops and goes idle. From the outside this looks like a run that
"succeeded": the routine records SUCCEEDED, the session burned real tokens, and nothing
was pushed.

Measured on 2026-09-15, four fires, four empty results:

| fire | model | ran for | output tokens | branch pushed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09-14 21:26 manual | Sonnet 5 | 4m43s | 10,308 | none |
| 09-15 06:39 scheduled | Sonnet 5 | 1m54s | 4,617 | none |
| 09-15 13:20 manual | Opus 5 | 5m49s | 17,967 | none |
| 09-15 13:27 minimal push test | Opus 5 | 4m52s | 12,563 | none |

Then two sessions differing in exactly one variable:

| session | `source_url` | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| diag A | declared | pushed `diag/with-source` |
| diag B | absent | BLOCKED: `"confirm: proceed with git push to seonkistall/aru?"` |

So the working shape is:

```
Routine (cron)  ->  supervisor session (has the repo, GitHub MCP, push rights)
                       -> create_session(source_url=...) -> worker does the cycle, pushes a branch
                       -> supervisor reviews the diff, opens the PR, merges it
```

The worker gets a fresh context every cycle, which is the point. The supervisor does the
parts the worker cannot: review with tools the worker lacks, and merge.

Two things follow for anyone editing the Routine:

- Never move the cycle back into a fresh-session Routine without also solving the source
  declaration. It will silently do nothing.
- A run that ends in a few minutes having pushed nothing is this failure, not a fast cycle.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-14 — Autopilot established. Cycle protocol, guardrails, revenue
  arithmetic and backlog written down for the first time.
- 2026-09-15 — Four scheduled fires produced nothing. Root cause found and
  fixed: fired sessions had no declared repository source, so every push blocked on an
  approval prompt nobody could answer. The Routine now wakes a supervisor session that
  spawns a properly sourced worker.
- 2026-09-15 — First worker cycle to land all four tracks.
  **smoke** was red on arrival for an environment reason (pinned Playwright browser
  build absent, CDN egress-blocked); `playwright.mobile.config.ts` gained an opt-in
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` override and the prerequisite is written into
  "One cycle" above.
  **bug** `distanceConfidence` in `lib/skin.ts` was sign-inverted outside the threshold
  band — confidence peaked at the decision boundary (0.9159 just below `lo`) and fell to
  0 for unambiguous readings. A clean capture of very calm skin scored 0.5759, under the
  0.58 gate, so the user was told 재촬영 권장 with an empty `retakeReasons` and
  `shouldApplyScan` discarded the scan entirely. Fixed; the same capture now scores
  0.9124. `tests/confidence-monotonicity.regression-12.test.ts` pins the invariant and
  7 of its 8 cases fail against the old body. Known consequence, now a backlog item: a
  single failed capture signal can no longer trip the confidence gate on its own (two
  or more still do, through `retakeReasons.length >= 2`), and `confidenceLabel` now
  reads 높음 for any frame whose three capture signals pass. Both are backlog items.
  Scope of the bug, measured on a feature grid rather than one hand-picked triple
  (shine 0-0.5, relRedness -0.03-0.08, cov 0-0.3, 51 steps each, all signals passing):
  41.54% of 132,651 points scored under the 0.58 gate before, 0% after, and no point
  moved the other way.
  **ML** `promotion_check` moved from the torch-importing trainer into stdlib-only
  `ml/subgroups.py`, which is what put it in reach of `ml/selftest.py` for the first
  time, and its `elif dimension == "tone" / elif "age"` chain became an unconditional
  `else`. `tone_x_age` — declared by the shipped manifest and structurally unevaluable
  on consumer scans, since every joint cell is `<tone>/unknown` — previously appended no
  blocker, so a run could report `promotable: True` with a declared fairness dimension
  never checked. That contradicted the manifest's own note. selftest went 44 -> 50 tests;
  3 of the new ones fail against the old branch.
  **UX** `share_landed` + `viralActivation`: the share loop counted sends and never
  arrivals, so it had a numerator and no denominator. Fired from the hash
  `MoodFromLink` already parses, surfaced in `/ops`.
  **research** `docs/share-preview-findings.md` — a per-result link preview is
  structurally impossible while the levels live in the fragment, demonstrated with a
  local HTTP probe and the Next 16.2.9 docs shipped in `node_modules`. Kakao's own spec
  is egress-blocked and is recorded as unverified rather than guessed.
- 2026-09-15 — Standing objective recorded: run until $10,000/month, owner-reported,
  with a revenue-upstream tie-breaker for backlog ordering. First cycle landed (PR #66).
- 2026-09-15 (cycle 2) — All four tracks landed, plus the commerce item they are
  ordered behind. Branch `autopilot/2026-09-15-1839`. `npm run smoke` green before any
  change and again after all of them; the baseline run needed the documented
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` override and nothing else. Final run:

  ```
   Test Files  63 passed (63)
        Tests  351 passed (351)
    44 passed (3.0m)
  Ran 66 tests in 0.014s
  OK
  Smoke test passed.
  ```

  **commerce (revenue-upstream #1)** The top backlog item was attempted first and
  stopped on its own rule: every merchant host refuses this network, so no product URL
  could be verified and none was invented. Recorded in the backlog entry with the
  verbatim curl output. What *was* fixable without a network is the path those URLs
  will arrive through, and it was broken. `commerceOverrideUrl` returned `null`
  identically for "not configured", "unparseable JSON" and "host not on the
  allowlist", and the caller falls back to the search URL — so a wrong affiliate URL
  is indistinguishable from no affiliate URL, while `NEXT_PUBLIC_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE=on`
  is separately telling users the link earns a commission. The repo walked into this
  itself: `docs/commerce-partnership-playbook.md` documented a `smartstore.naver.com`
  override as its worked example for `naver-shopping`, and the gate rejects that host.
  Measured against `isAllowedCommerceUrl` before the fix:

  ```
  ALLOW  https://www.oliveyoung.co.kr/store/goods/getGoodsDetail.do?goodsNo=A000000123456
  ALLOW  https://search.shopping.naver.com/search/all?query=x
  BLOCK  https://shopping.naver.com/catalog/12345678
  BLOCK  https://smartstore.naver.com/brand/products/12345678
  BLOCK  https://brand.naver.com/brand/products/12345678
  ALLOW  https://www.coupang.com/vp/products/1234567890
  BLOCK  https://link.coupang.com/a/abcdef
  BLOCK  https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA123456
  override returned: null
  ```

  Fixed by making the rejection loud, not by widening the allowlist: `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is
  what keeps `/api/out` from being an open redirect and none of the blocked hosts above
  could be verified as a real affiliate link host from here. New
  `auditCommerceOverrides()` separates accepted from rejected and distinguishes
  unparseable JSON from unset; `commerceOverrideUrl` warns once per distinct env value
  naming the sku, merchant and URL. The runbook's example is now one the gate accepts,
  the hosts a real link may need are listed as explicitly unverified, and
  `tests/commerce.test.ts` pins the runbook's allowlist and its worked example against
  the code so the two cannot drift again. A misspelled *merchant* key is reported too;
  a misspelled *sku* id is not, because `lib/skus.ts` imports `lib/commerce.ts` and
  checking the catalogue there would be a cycle — that gap is pinned by a test and
  listed in the backlog rather than left implied. With `lib/commerce.ts` and the
  playbook reverted to `origin/main`, `6 failed | 7 passed (13)` — the file has 5
  pre-existing cases and 8 new ones, of which 6 fail without the fix, three with
  `TypeError: auditCommerceOverrides is not a function`. The two new cases that pass
  either way are no-regression guards, not evidence.

  **ML** The promotion gate now refuses a head that learned nothing. `qwk` and
  `pearson` were computed and compared to nothing, so the only thing the gate measured
  was the subgroup gap — which a constant predictor passes easily, being perfectly
  even-handed. `promotionGate.ordinal` (`minQwk` / `minPearson`, both 0.40) is in the
  shipped manifest and in `model_contract.FALLBACK_ORDINAL_GATE`, and
  `subgroups.ordinal_check` blocks per axis, including when an axis reports no qwk at
  all. Fed the repo's own `metrics_from_confusion` a majority-class predictor on three
  axes with a subgroup layout that passes on its own:

  ```
  per-axis metrics of a majority-class predictor (3 axes, 100 samples each):
    oil      accuracy=0.8000 within_one_grade=0.9500 ordinal_mae=0.2500 qwk=0.0000 pearson=0.0000
    redness  accuracy=0.8000 within_one_grade=0.9500 ordinal_mae=0.2500 qwk=0.0000 pearson=0.0000
    pores    accuracy=0.8000 within_one_grade=0.9500 ordinal_mae=0.2500 qwk=0.0000 pearson=0.0000

  BEFORE (origin/main):  promotable = True   blockers = []
  AFTER  (this branch):  promotable = False
     blocker: [oil] qwk 0.000 is below the floor 0.400
     blocker: [oil] pearson 0.000 is below the floor 0.400
     blocker: [redness] qwk 0.000 is below the floor 0.400
     ...
  ```

  A non-finite score blocks too, which it does not do by itself: `float("nan") < 0.4`
  is `False`, and NaN is exactly what the reference implementations return on the
  degenerate matrices where ARU's own scorers return 0.0. So is a run that evaluated
  no axis at all. The three scorers moved out of the torch-importing trainer into
  stdlib-only `ml/ordinal_metrics.py` — the same move `promotion_check` made, for the
  same reason: it is what puts them in reach of `ml/selftest.py`, and an AST
  comparison against `origin/main` confirms all three bodies are unchanged. selftest
  went 50 -> 66 tests.

  **research** `docs/ordinal-metric-verification.md`. Gating on a metric means first
  checking it is the metric. `pypi.org` turned out to be the only reachable host of
  eight probed, which made reference implementations available: over 1,982 random
  confusion matrices, ARU's kappa agrees with
  `sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score(weights="quadratic")` to **6.661e-16** and its
  correlation with `scipy.stats.pearsonr` to **1.110e-15**. The two deliberate
  divergences are both where the reference is undefined, and both resolve conservatively
  (0.0, which blocks). The 0.40 floor was then chosen from a measured table of nine
  predictors rather than a benchmark band, because no page stating those bands is
  reachable — which the doc says outright rather than citing one from memory. Neither
  library is or becomes a dependency.

  **UX** The funnel started at the shutter, so everything lost before it counted as
  nothing having happened — a refused camera permission in particular was invisible.
  `home_viewed`, `scan_opened`, `camera_blocked` (with a `reason` of
  permission/busy/notfound/unsupported/attach), `care_viewed` and `checkin_opened` now
  fire, the last of which is the only measure of whether the re-engagement emails bring
  anyone back. `captureStart` and `cameraBlockRate` are conditioned on `scan_opened`
  and shown in `/ops`. The existing drop-off chart was deliberately left anchored on
  `scan_started`: it is a cumulative intersection from stage 0, so re-anchoring it
  would zero every stage of an event log recorded before this change. A shared
  `useFunnelPageView` hook carries the StrictMode double-invoke guard the four pages
  would otherwise each need.

  **bug** Two, both found by an adversarial hunt rather than a report, both with tests
  that fail against `origin/main`.

  `latestConsent` (`lib/consent.ts`) skipped its scope filter entirely when the caller
  passed no scope, so an unscoped read saw every participant's events — the exact
  fail-open shape `latestConsentGranted` in `lib/sync-payload.ts` already carries a
  comment warning about, and the last place still using the loose form.
  `recordConsentEvent` dedupes against it, so on a device that had ever run a pilot
  session, a consumer ticking 학습용 크롭 저장 matched P001's grant and **no event was
  written at all**: the UI showed the toggle on, `resolveCaptureConsent` (which does
  match scope exactly) then found no unscoped grant and discarded the crop, and the
  person's own consent decision never entered the audit trail. Guardrail 4. Measured
  before the fix:

  ```
  stored after the pilot grant      : 1
  consumer grant returns pid        : "P001" (expected undefined)
  stored after the consumer grant   : 1 (expected 2)
  resolveCaptureConsent(no scope)   : null -> crop discarded
  latestConsent(no scope).pid       : "P001"
  ```

  Fail-closed, so nothing was captured that should not have been — but `/ops` was also
  reporting that participant's decision as the device's consent state. 4 of the 5 new
  cases in `tests/consent-storage.test.ts` fail against `origin/main`.

  Second: `buildReportTrust().sourceLabel` is stored in a map and passed to `t()` as a
  variable, so `tests/i18n-coverage.test.ts`'s regex over `t("…")` literals never saw
  it, and neither `기기에서 확인` nor `기기 확인 + 선택한 AI 분석` existed as a key in
  any of the four dictionaries. English is the default language, so the first chip on
  the `/report` trust card read raw Korean for every non-Korean user. `피부 선명도` in
  the live camera checklist was missing from `ja` and `zh` for the same reason. Both
  fixed, and the coverage test now walks all three `AnalysisSource` values and the
  camera checklist labels explicitly — the two new cases fail against `origin/main`
  with `"기기에서 확인" missing from en dictionary` and `"피부 선명도" missing from ja
  dictionary`.

  **review** The diff was reviewed adversarially by a subagent before commit, and the
  review changed it. Worth recording because the cycle protocol asks for this step and
  it is only worth the tokens if it finds things:

  - The stated justification for the 0.40 floor was **refuted by row 7 of its own
    table**. The draft claimed the floor separates predictors that beat the trivial
    baseline from those that do not; "correct 60%, else off by exactly one" scores
    accuracy 0.7696 (below always-majority's 0.8000) at qwk 0.6657, so it clears the
    floor while being less accurate than the baseline. The numbers were real, the
    inference over them was not. `docs/ordinal-metric-verification.md` now states only
    what the table supports and says plainly what the earlier draft got wrong.
  - NaN bypassed the new gate (above).
  - `test_the_manifest_supplies_the_ordinal_floor` asserted `0.4`, which
    `FALLBACK_ORDINAL_GATE` supplies whether or not the manifest declares it — so
    reverting the shipped manifest left selftest green and the guardrail-8 half of the
    change had no coverage. Replaced with a test that reads the manifest, plus one
    that makes the fallback disagree and checks the manifest wins.
  - `/ops` printed "0% of scan opens" where there were no scan opens at all, turning
    "no data" into a measurement of total failure. Now renders `—`.
  - A misspelled merchant key was reported as *accepted* — the same silent no-op the
    change claims to close. Now an `unknown-merchant` issue; the sku half is a
    documented, tested gap rather than an implied fix.
  - Two numbers in this changelog were wrong: "4 of the 7 new commerce cases" (the
    file has 8 new cases and 6 of them fail without the fix), and the blockers list
    presented `http=000` and `CONNECT tunnel failed` as two different outcomes when
    they are one failure seen through two curl invocations. Both corrected.
  - The verification scripts were uncommitted, so the research numbers rested on
    something nobody could re-run. They are now `ml/tools/verify_ordinal_metrics.py`
    and `ml/tools/ordinal_floor_table.py`, seeded, with the optional imports inside
    `main()`; both reproduce the doc's tables exactly.

  Also dropped a `props` parameter from `useFunnelPageView` that nothing passed, and
  corrected three stale comments (`supabase/schema.sql`'s funnel-kind list, the
  `camera_blocked` reason list, and the claim that the two new rates cannot sum above
  1 — a session refused once and then capturing is in both).
