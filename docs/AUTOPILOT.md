# ARU Autopilot

A scheduled session picks this file up every 6 hours, does one cycle, and writes
back to it. It is the only state that survives between cycles — a fresh session
starts with no memory of the last one.

Last updated: 2026-09-14

## What this is for

ARU should end up used by real people and earning money. The loop exists to make
the product better every cycle without a human in the seat for each one.

Be clear-eyed about what the loop can and cannot move:

- **It can** raise product quality, close the ML gap, fix bugs, tighten the funnel,
  and prepare everything a launch needs.
- **It cannot** acquire users, sign an affiliate contract, or create demand. Those
  are owner actions, and they sit in BLOCKERS below.

### The revenue arithmetic, written down so no cycle forgets it

Target: **$10,000 / month**. ARU's only revenue surface today is the commerce
out-link (`/api/out` → `lib/commerce.ts`).

| Quantity | Value | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Typical Korean skincare basket | ~₩30,000 (~$22) | catalogue price band in `lib/skus.ts` |
| Affiliate commission | 3–10% depending on programme | Coupang Partners / Naver / Olive Young terms |
| Revenue per converted click | ~$0.7–2.2 | basket × commission |
| Conversions needed per month | **~4,500–14,000** | $10,000 ÷ revenue per conversion |
| Scan→purchase conversion (optimistic) | 2–5% | affiliate-content benchmark, unverified for this product |
| Monthly scans implied | **~100,000–700,000** | conversions ÷ conversion rate |

Two things follow, and every cycle should act on them rather than re-deriving them:

1. **The links earn $0 today.** `addCommerceTracking()` adds UTM parameters only —
   no affiliate or partner id. `COMMERCE_LINK_OVERRIDES_JSON` is the designed
   insertion point for real affiliate URLs. Until the owner signs up for the
   programmes, 100% of traffic monetises at zero, whatever the loop builds.
2. **Traffic is the binding constraint, not features.** At six figures of monthly
   scans the product needs to be excellent; at zero scans it does not matter how
   excellent it is. Cycles should prefer work that either (a) makes the product
   worth returning to and sharing, or (b) instruments what actually happens, over
   work that only adds surface.

## One cycle

Each firing does all of this, in order. One coherent improvement per track is
better than four half-finished ones.

1. **Orient.** Read this file. Run `git log --oneline -10` and read the last
   CHANGELOG entries so the cycle does not redo finished work.
2. **Verify green.** `npm run smoke` must pass before any change. If it is red,
   fixing that is the whole cycle.
3. **Research** (자료조사). One concrete question that the next step needs
   answered — a dataset licence, a Play policy, a Korean affiliate programme's
   terms, a competitor's onboarding, an ML technique. Verify against a primary
   source; record the finding and the source in the right doc. Never record a
   search snippet as a fact.
4. **ML.** Move the scan model forward: calibration, subgroup coverage, an index
   that needs validating, a metric that is missing, an inconsistency between
   `lib/skin.ts` and the Python pipeline. `python ml/selftest.py` must stay green.
5. **UI/UX and user flow.** One real improvement to what a user sees or how far
   they get: a drop-off in `lib/funnel.ts`, a screen that is confusing on a
   360px phone, copy that overpromises, a locale that reads like a translation.
6. **Bug fix.** Hunt actively rather than waiting for a report: run the app, read
   an error path, check a boundary. Fix at least one real defect, with a test
   that fails without the fix.
7. **Land it.** `npm run smoke` green → commit → push a branch → open a PR →
   merge it → update this file's CHANGELOG and BACKLOG → update `README.md` if
   anything a reader would care about changed.

Use subagents freely for fan-out — parallel research angles, parallel review
lenses, adversarial verification of anything before it is written down as true.
Verification is where the loop earns its keep: an unverified "improvement" that
looks right is worse than no change, because the next cycle builds on it.

## Hard guardrails

These are not preferences. Breaking one is worse than skipping a cycle.

1. **Never push a red build.** `npm run smoke` green before every push, no exceptions.
   If it cannot be made green, revert the change and record why in BLOCKERS.
2. **Never fabricate evidence.** Every number written into a doc, PR body or
   CHANGELOG must be the actual output of a command that actually ran. Paste real
   output. If a run was not done, say it was not done.
3. **Never make a medical claim.** ARU describes cosmetic tendencies visible in a
   photo. No diagnosis, no treatment, no condition monitoring, in any language.
   `efficacyClean()` stays on every LLM product reason.
4. **Never merge the two consent streams** (AI analysis / learning crop) or weaken
   the audit trail.
5. **Never ship a face image off-device** beyond the existing consented crop path,
   and never write a person identifier next to their measurements in an export.
6. **Never commit dataset images**, model weights over a few MB, or anything from a
   gated dataset.
7. **Never change a dataset licence tier** on anything other than a term the owner
   has actually read and reported. The current tiers and their evidence live in
   `ml/external_datasets.json`.
8. **Never promote a model** past the gate in `public/models/visible-attributes/manifest.json`.
9. **Surgical changes only.** Every diff traces to a backlog item or a defect. No
   refactor-for-its-own-sake, no dependency added without a reason in the PR body.
10. **Never push to `main` directly.** Branch → PR → merge.

## Backlog

`[AI]` the loop can do alone. `[OWNER]` needs a human, an account, or a signature.

### Now

- [AI] Validate the blemish-detection constants (`BLEMISH` in `lib/skin.ts`) against
  real photos through `/eval`, and replace them with calibrated values. They were
  chosen on a synthetic face.
- [AI] Server-side funnel telemetry. `lib/funnel.ts` is localStorage-only, so nobody
  can see where users drop off. Without it every UX cycle is guessing.
- [AI] Measure the real per-scan cost of the new within-image indices on a mid-range
  phone profile, not on the build container.
- [AI] Share surface: a scan result worth sending to a friend is the only organic
  acquisition loop the product has. Audit `app/components/share-card.tsx` against
  what actually renders in KakaoTalk.
- [OWNER] **Apply to the affiliate programmes** (Coupang Partners, Naver 쇼핑파트너,
  Olive Young). Until then every out-click earns $0. This is the single highest-
  leverage item on the whole list.
- [OWNER] AI-Hub 71645 data application (domestic applicant, account required).
- [OWNER] Golden set: 20–30 real photos with two-operator consensus labels, so the
  camera thresholds come from faces instead of from a synthetic frame.

### Next

- [AI] Tone and dryness have no label source. Propose the smallest consented way to
  collect one, with the PIPA consequences spelled out; do not implement it alone.
- [AI] Recommendation quality: the reasons are LLM-generated and efficacy-filtered,
  but nothing measures whether they are *useful*. Design a measurable proxy.
- [AI] iPhone Safari camera matrix is code-verified but hardware-pending; extend the
  automated lifecycle coverage as far as it can go without hardware.
- [OWNER] Google Play Console identity, payment account, support email, App Signing.

## Blockers

Owner-only, dated when first recorded.

- 2026-09-14 — Affiliate programme sign-ups. No partner id exists anywhere in the
  codebase; `COMMERCE_LINK_OVERRIDES_JSON` is ready to receive real URLs.
- 2026-09-14 — AI-Hub 71645 data itself. Licence is `commercial_ok` on the owner's
  reading of the terms; the data still needs an approved application.
- 2026-09-14 — Real golden-set photos with consensus labels.
- 2026-09-14 — Physical-device QA: iPhone Safari matrix, Play internal track.

## How the schedule actually runs

A Routine that creates its own fresh session **cannot do this job**, and the reason is
worth keeping written down because it costs a day to rediscover.

`create_trigger` has no parameter for a repository source, so every session it spawns
starts with `sources: []`. A session without the repo declared as a source hits an
approval prompt the moment it writes to that repo, and an unattended session has nobody
to approve it, so it stops and goes idle. From the outside this looks like a run that
"succeeded": the routine records SUCCEEDED, the session burned real tokens, and nothing
was pushed.

Measured on 2026-09-15, four fires, four empty results:

| fire | model | ran for | output tokens | branch pushed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09-14 21:26 manual | Sonnet 5 | 4m43s | 10,308 | none |
| 09-15 06:39 scheduled | Sonnet 5 | 1m54s | 4,617 | none |
| 09-15 13:20 manual | Opus 5 | 5m49s | 17,967 | none |
| 09-15 13:27 minimal push test | Opus 5 | 4m52s | 12,563 | none |

Then two sessions differing in exactly one variable:

| session | `source_url` | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| diag A | declared | pushed `diag/with-source` |
| diag B | absent | BLOCKED: `"confirm: proceed with git push to seonkistall/aru?"` |

So the working shape is:

```
Routine (cron)  ->  supervisor session (has the repo, GitHub MCP, push rights)
                       -> create_session(source_url=...) -> worker does the cycle, pushes a branch
                       -> supervisor reviews the diff, opens the PR, merges it
```

The worker gets a fresh context every cycle, which is the point. The supervisor does the
parts the worker cannot: review with tools the worker lacks, and merge.

Two things follow for anyone editing the Routine:

- Never move the cycle back into a fresh-session Routine without also solving the source
  declaration. It will silently do nothing.
- A run that ends in a few minutes having pushed nothing is this failure, not a fast cycle.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-14 — Autopilot established. Cycle protocol, guardrails, revenue
  arithmetic and backlog written down for the first time.
- 2026-09-15 — Four scheduled fires produced nothing. Root cause found and
  fixed: fired sessions had no declared repository source, so every push blocked on an
  approval prompt nobody could answer. The Routine now wakes a supervisor session that
  spawns a properly sourced worker.
